# Current work

This page is a bounded navigation record, not evidence. Read the [evidence ledger](EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md) for current proof standing and source-linked claims.

## Active milestone

Author new levels. The curve is fixed, so new levels can be born calibrated rather than hand-guessed. [BL-0004](docs/backlog/BL-0004-build-level-authoring-tracer.md)'s tracer is complete and its one candidate is shipped: Level 51, the first level whose target was never hand-picked (measured demand, `DECISION-0003`) and the first with direct human playtest evidence, not just a bot win rate (`RESULT-0009`). The historical design remains at [the level-authoring loop spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-08-level-authoring-loop-design.md); measurement is grounded in `solver/game-tester.js`.

**Read [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) before touching this milestone further** — a 2026-08-17 session conflated the pipeline built so far (measures and validates a *human-picked* shape) with a level generator (invents shapes on its own), which does not exist. That handoff also lists three more candidates from that session in three different states: one ready to ship (52), one correctly rejected (53, real lockouts), and one whose playtest doesn't count (54, tested on a memorized board — needs a fresh seed before its 85%-demand question is actually answered).

The milestone itself isn't closed. What's left is an open choice, not a default: ship more hand-picked candidates one at a time, or build the actual generator.

## Done — the level curve

Every level is winnable. No level sits below a 5% bot win rate, against 34 levels at 0% before ([RESULT-0008](EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md#result-0008--every-level-is-winnable-after-the-demand-based-retune)).

A target is now a measured share of that level's achievable score, and tile scale doubles once per ten-level chapter so dealt tiles stay on the 2/4/8/16/32/64/128 family ([DECISION-0003](EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md#decision-0003--targets-are-a-measured-share-of-achievable-score-tile-scale-doubles-per-chapter)). Tile scale does not affect difficulty — it multiplies the target and achievable score together — so difficulty is carried entirely by demand.

## Parked

The Level 26 exact-proof track, by [DECISION-0002](EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md#decision-0002--park-the-exact-proof-track-tune-levels-from-measured-calibration). 13,000 reachability and the exact maximum stay open. The frozen study is pinned to its original scale-1 board and 13,000 target, so the retune did not move it. [BL-0001](docs/backlog/BL-0001-test-compact-state-signature.md) and [BL-0002](docs/backlog/BL-0002-evaluate-decisive-proof-formulation.md) are parked with it.

## Accepted, not fixed

- **Roughly 15 levels have a target lower than the level before.** The remaining lever is the move budget, and spending it would make a level's pacing a side effect of target cosmetics. Revisit from playtest feel, not from a monotonicity rule.
- **The reference bot is a weak proxy for a skilled player.** Every recorded win rate is a floor on human success, not an estimate. The margin is unquantified.
- **Lockouts persist at up to ~5% on the late levels.** A lockout is a dead board, not a fair loss. Bounded by `solver/verify-loop.js`.

## Priced and rejected — do not re-propose without new evidence

- **Enrich the spawn pool.** Raising spawned value 76% bought 13% more score ([RESULT-0006](EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md#result-0006--spawning-16s-does-not-lift-the-ceiling)). More distinct values means more chain sums fall off the matchable lattice ([FACT-0006](EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md#fact-0006--the-mergeable-sum-lattice-and-what-a-lockout-is)). Future direction only: [BL-0003](docs/backlog/BL-0003-widen-spawn-pool.md).
- **Enlarge the move budget.** Works to about level 31 and saturates after ([RESULT-0007](EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md#result-0007--more-moves-rescue-the-mid-levels-and-saturate-on-the-late-ones)).

## Useful commands

```bash
node solver/verify-loop.js                              # curve health gate; exit 0 = PASS
node solver/game-tester.js --seeds 150                  # compare tile-scaling policies
node solver/game-tester.js --policy powers2 --detail    # the shipped policy, per level
node --test solver/tests/*.test.js
```
